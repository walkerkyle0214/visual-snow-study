            <h2>Research Study Participation</h2>
            <p>
                You are being asked to participate in a research project entitled: <strong>The effect of simulated visual snow on an object search task</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We are conducting this research study to better understand if visual snow has an effect on visual search performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the experiment you will be asked to find the five objects within a complex visual field. Once the objects are found, or you choose to stop participating in the task, you will be asked to go to the next page where you will be asked to answer questions about how you felt during the task. The total time for this experiment should take approximately five minutes, and at most, ten minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                This research is being conducted by senior psychology major Ashley Rabbitt, and Dr. Jenks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experiment is anonymous - no identifying information will be recorded from the participants. The experiment is conducted online, through an encrypted website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The benefit from participating in this experiment is gaining credit through the research pool if you are taking PSY 101 at RSC. You will also gain experience in being a research participant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Potential risks of participating in this experiment include being bored while taking the experiment, potential stress from participating in the task. There is always a possibility of a potential security breach even in a fire-walled, encrypted website.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are under the age of 18 you are not allowed to participate in this study. If you would like to participate in this experiment, you must be at least 18 years old or older.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Task Instructions</h3>
            <div class="study-instructions-detail">
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Locate 5 target objects in an image by clicking on them.</p>
                
                <h4>Task Procedure:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>The target objects will be clearly listed for reference</li>
                    <li>Click directly on objects in the image when you identify them</li>
                    <li>Response time will be recorded throughout the task</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Scoring:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Your goal is to identify all 5 objects with maximum accuracy</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Visual Conditions:</h4>
